- **Blog Details**: View a single blog post by ID.
- **404 Page**: A custom "Not Found" page for invalid routes.

## Project Structure

- `App.js`: The main component that sets up routing between different pages.
- `Navbar.js`: The navigation bar for easy access to pages.
- `Home.js`: Displays a list of all blog posts.
- `Create.js`: A form component to add new blogs.
- `BlogId.js`: Fetches and displays a specific blog post using its ID.
